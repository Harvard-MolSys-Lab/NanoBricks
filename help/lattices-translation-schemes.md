Lattices and Translation Schemes
================================

NanoBricks is built around two key ideas:

- DNA strands are placed (mostly) on a semi-regular grid of voxels (a *lattice*)
- Voxels can be mapped to strands by following some set of rules (a *translation scheme*)

The lattice controls the layout of the DNA helices in 3D space, as well as their connectivity to one another.

The translation scheme controls how voxels are converted into strands.
