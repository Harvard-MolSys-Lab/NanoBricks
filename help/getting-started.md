Getting Started
===============

Welcome to NanoBricks; there are 3 easy steps to start building nanostructures:

1. Draw voxels
2. Build strands
3. Generate sequences


## 1. Draw voxels

When you begin, you'll already be using the *Pointer* tool, which you can use to place voxels; click to place, shift-click to delete, or hold alt and move the mouse to paint. Drag the mouse to look around (orbit). Instructions for using the tool show up in a blue box to the top left, right under the toolbar.

If you don't want to draw, you can also import files from another 3D modeling program, using the *Import* button in the main toolbar. Follow the instructions in the top left.

## 2. Build strands

Click the "Voxels > Strands" button in the toolbar to generate strands from your voxel design; you should see a bunch of blue and black lines appear---those are your strands. You can toggle the Voxels view off from the "Views" pane on the right in order to see your strands better.

## 3. Generate sequences

Click the "Sequences" button in the toolbar to open the sequences window. Choose "Random" from the dropdown. Click "Generate & Thread;" you should see a bunch of sequences.

## Next steps...

You're done! Now you can...

- Export your sequences to a CSV file and order them from a DNA synthesis company
- Export a picture of your structure to an SVG file (for editing in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator)
- Export a model of your structure in STL format (for 3D printing) or OBJ (for editing in another 3D modeling program).
